                I'm a resident of Raleigh NC looking to kick start my career in web development.
                You may be thinking, "kick start? great, this guy is green." But wait! Don't write 
                me off just yet. There are a lot of inspiring words I could use to describe myself, 
                but the reality is I enjoy a challenge and seek perfection in what I do.   
                Prior to my "techiness", I was employed by the Inter-Faith 
                Food Shuttle and served my community with some really "cool" people. I
                graduated from the Code Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill in July 2018. I am 
                currently pursuing an Associate of Engineering at Wake Tech. My
                goal is to earn a Bachelor of Computer Science at NC State.
